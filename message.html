<div class="message-container">
    <p>How are you doing today?? I know you weren't expecting this. When I sent you this link, u might be thinking, "why would bro send me a link?? It's my birthday for crying out loud🤣🤣" I wanted to text you today but I said, hey, texting you would be boring. Why not just let me make this special, why not make this different. That's how i came up with the idea of coding this site, just for you 😊😊. Don't think I'm the one that designed this oo. It's AI oo 🤣. Though I know how to code, but I'm still a beginner 🤣. It'll take a while to master this thing real time. So, I just told it and boom, here we have it. I just wanted to make this year a special one for you.</p><br>
    <p>I want to take a moment to think back, to remind you of how you've been a blessing to me since I met you. Since I've met you, I'm always happy. Though it's not everyday, coz everyday has its own challenges, but to be honest, you have a way of making me laugh, smile. You have been the only one that I've trusted so far, despite the fact that we haven't even seen each other face-to-face. I feel this strong connection between us. You have always been there for me.</p><br>
    <p>You were there when I needed someone to talk to, a shoulder to cry on when I need to 🤣, I trust you so mcuh and thank you for not betraying me. I really do appreciate it.Thank you for being my rock, my defender, supporter, my back-bone. You have been there for me since day one. And this is actually the first friendship that I've had no quarrel with. I really cherish our friendship. When I was hailing you, it's not me trying to propose oo 🤣🤣. I was actually being real</p><br>
    <img src="herphoto.jpg" alt="Her Photo" class="her-photo">
    <p>This is literally like the only photo of you that I have 🤣</p><br>
    <p>I just want you to know that I love you, not as lovers, but as friends, I cherish u so mcuh, you mean the world to me and I really mean it. I pray our friendship grows stronger. I just want you to know that I won't forget you. I love you a whole lot Aanu. I am actually feeling emotional doing this right now 😞😞</p>
